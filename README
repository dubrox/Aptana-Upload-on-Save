This script is ment to be used with Eclipse Monkey Script.
It allows to upload the current file on save, automatically.
For an example of how to add it to your Eclipse IDE 
search on Google or try this link:

The author of the cool stuff of the script is Ingo Muschenetz,
while I (dubrox) only added few lines of code to make it easy to
enable and disable the script.

This script needs to be enabled (clicked) everytime the IDE is started.
I considered this to be a proper behaviour so you won't end uploading
files accidentally to your server.
